# Weather-Journal App

This project is part of the Udacity Professional Nanodegree in Frontend Web Development. The Weather-Journal App allows users to retrieve weather data from an API and dynamically update the user interface with the latest weather information.

## Features

- Weather Data Retrieval: The app fetches weather data from a selected API, providing real-time weather information based on user input.
- Asynchronous JavaScript: The app utilizes asynchronous JavaScript, allowing for seamless data retrieval without blocking the main thread.
- Dynamic User Interface: The user interface is dynamically updated to display the retrieved weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, and location details.
- User Input and Data Storage: Users can enter their location or zip code, which is used to fetch the corresponding weather data. The app also stores the user's feelings or additional notes alongside the weather data.

## Getting Started
